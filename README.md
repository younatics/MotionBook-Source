#### Welocome to MotionBook!
Before start, MotionBook source is complicated and little bit messy. Please help us to develop this source much better than before! 
MotionBook is open source based project. Because of that, I decided to open [MotionBook](https://appsto.re/kr/8yv1hb.i) source.

Hopes this repo help someone :)
